Thymeleaf - Spring Security integration modules
===============================================


**[Please make sure to select the branch corresponding to the version of Thymeleaf you are using]**


Status
------

This is a *Thymeleaf Extras* module, not a part of the Thymeleaf core (and as
such following its own versioning schema), but fully supported by the Thymeleaf
team.

This repository contains 3 projects:

 * **thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity3** for integration with Spring Security 3.x
 * **thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity4** for integration with Spring Security 4.x
 * **thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5** for integration with Spring Security 5.x

Current versions: 

 * **Version 3.0.5.RELEASE** - for Thymeleaf 3.0 (requires Thymeleaf 3.0.10+)
 * **Version 2.1.3.RELEASE** - for Thymeleaf 2.1 (requires Thymeleaf 2.1.2+)

Requirements (3.0.x)
--------------------

 * Thymeleaf **3.0.10+**
 * Spring Framework version **3.0.x** to **5.1.x**
 * Spring Security version **3.0.x** to **5.1.x**
 * Web environment (Spring Security integration cannot work offline). Works with
   both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.


Maven info
----------

 * groupId: `org.thymeleaf.extras`   
 * artifactId: 
    * Spring Security 3 integration package: `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity3`
    * Spring Security 4 integration package: `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity4`
    * Spring Security 5 integration package: `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5`



Features
--------

This module provides a new dialect called `org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity3.dialect.SpringSecurityDialect`, 
`org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity4.dialect.SpringSecurityDialect` or 
`org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity5.dialect.SpringSecurityDialect` (depending
on the Spring Security version), with default prefix `sec`. It includes:
  
 * New expression utility objects:
    * `#authentication` representing the Spring Security authentication object
      (an object implementing the `org.springframework.security.core.Authentication`
      interface).
    * `#authorization`: a expression utility object with methods for checking
       authorization based on expressions, URLs and Access Control Lists.
 * New attributes:
    * `sec:authentication="prop"` outputs a `prop` property of the
      authentication object, similar to the Spring Security `<sec:authentication/>`
      JSP tag.
    * `sec:authorize="expr"` or `sec:authorize-expr="expr"` renders the element
      children (*tag content*) if the authenticated user is authorized to see it
      according to the specified *Spring Security expression*.
    * `sec:authorize-url="url"` renders the element children (*tag content*) if
      the authenticated user is authorized to see the specified URL.
    * `sec:authorize-acl="object :: permissions"` renders the element children
      (*tag content*) if the authenticated user has the specified permissions on
      the specified domain object, according to Spring Source's Access Control
      List system.


Configuration
-------------

In order to use the thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity[3|4|5] modules in our Spring
MVC application (or thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5 in a Spring WebFlux
application), we will first need to configure our application in the usual way
for Spring + Thymeleaf applications (*TemplateEngine* bean, *template resolvers*, 
etc.), and add the SpringSecurity dialect to our Template Engine so that we can
use the `sec:*` attributes and special expression utility objects:

```xml
<bean id="templateEngine" class="org.thymeleaf.spring5.SpringTemplateEngine">
  ...
  <property name="additionalDialects">
    <set>
      <!-- Note the package would change to 'springsecurity[3|4]' if you are using that version -->
      <bean class="org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity5.dialect.SpringSecurityDialect"/>
    </set>
  </property>
...
</bean>
```

And that's all!

**NOTE**: If we are using Thymeleaf in a Spring Boot application, all that will
be needed is to add the corresponding Thymeleaf and Spring Security starters to
our application as well as the `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity[3|4|5]`
dependency, and this dialect will be automatically configured for us.


Using the expression utility objects
------------------------------------

The `#authentication` object can be easily used, like this:

```html
<div th:text="${#authentication.name}">
  The value of the "name" property of the authentication object should appear here.
</div>
```

The `#authorization` object can be used in a similar way, normally in `th:if`
or `th:unless` tags:

```html
<div th:if="${#authorization.expression('hasRole(''ROLE_ADMIN'')')}">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user has role ROLE_ADMIN.
</div>
```

The `#authorization` object is an instance of `org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity[3|4].auth.Authorization`,
see this class and its documentation to understand all the methods offered.


Using the attributes
--------------------

Using the `sec:authentication` attribute is equivalent to using the `#authentication`
object, but using its own attribute:

```html
<div sec:authentication="name">
  The value of the "name" property of the authentication object should appear here.
</div>
```

The `sec:authorize` and `sec:authorize-expr` attributes are exactly the same.
They work equivalently to a `th:if` that evaluated an `#authorization.expression(...)`
expression, by evaluating a *Spring Security Expression*:

```html
<div sec:authorize="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user has role ROLE_ADMIN.
</div>
```

These *Spring Security Expressions* in `sec:authorize` attributes are in fact
Spring EL expressions evaluated on a SpringSecurity-specific root object
containing methods such as `hasRole(...)`, `getPrincipal()`, etc.

As with normal Spring EL expressions, Thymeleaf allows you to access a series of
objects from them including the context variables map (the `#vars` object). In
fact, you are allowed to surround your access expression with `${...}` if it
makes you feel more comfortable:

```html
<div sec:authorize="${hasRole(#vars.expectedRole)}">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user has a role computed by the controller.
</div>
```

Remember that Spring Security sets a special security-oriented object as
expression root, which is why you would not be able to access the `expectedRole`
variable directly in the above expression. 

Another way of checking authorization is `sec:authorize-url`, which allows you
to check whether a user is authorized to visit a specific URL or not:

```html
<div sec:authorize-url="/admin">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user can call the "/admin" URL.
</div>
```

For specifying a specific HTTP method, do:

```html
<div sec:authorize-url="POST /admin">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user can call the "/admin" URL
  using the POST HTTP method.
</div>
```

Finally, there is an attribute for checking authorization using Spring Security's
*Access Control Lists*, which needs the specification of a domain object and the
*permissions* defined on it that we are asking for.

```html
<div sec:authorize-acl="${obj} :: '1,3'">
  This will only be displayed if authenticated user has permissions "1" and "3"
  on domain object referenced by context variable "obj".
</div>
```

In this attribute, both domain object and permission specifications are considered
to be thymeleaf *Standard Expressions*.


### Namespace

The namespace for all versions of this dialect is `http://www.thymeleaf.org/extras/spring-security`.

```html
<html xmlns:sec="http://www.thymeleaf.org/extras/spring-security">
```

Getting the namespace incorrect won't impact processing of your template. It
might however impact your IDE when it comes to things like suggestions/auto-completion
in your templates.
